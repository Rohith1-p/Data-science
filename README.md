# Why data science is important  
Now we know what data science is used for, let’s look at what makes data science so important. Why do we need to pull and analyse all of this data? 

The data collected from data science can be used in various ways within a business. It’s not just the data teams that utilise it – marketers, software engineers, and those making business decisions all have a hand in data science. 

By analysing data, we can determine trends and patterns to help us make better decisions within a business. These decisions will vary greatly depending on the type of business, but data acts as a useful tool to make informed decisions.

Rather than going in blind and assuming the outcome of a campaign or a business strategy, we can interpret and analyse data sets. By doing so, we’ll have evidence that our work has the potential to make a difference. 

The impact of data science
As well as helping make business decisions regarding strategies and plans, data can also inform us of what not to do. If we see negative trends and correlations within data, this tells us that whatever caused it should be avoided. As a result, we can then test other elements to find a more favourable outcome. 

The use of data can be effective for growth, reduce uncertainty, and can save money on what would otherwise be wasted efforts. Big companies such as Netflix use big data in various ways to retain customers, create the right content and save on spending. 

## Data science process and concepts
So, how does such a powerful process work? Let’s look at the data science process and discuss some data science concepts. The process of collecting data as a data scientist is as follows: 

Collecting data from a variety of sources
Prepare collected data for analysis
Perform analysis of data
Determine useful insights
Visualise insights in a digestible format
Share insights with others 
Make informed decisions based on findings
How you carry out these steps and which tools you use will depend on the data and business. To find out more about the data science process, check out our Introduction to Data Science for Business course. 

## Data science concepts
There is a wide range of concepts used within the data science field. Let’s explore just a few of these concepts. 

## Data mining
With so much data being constantly collected, not all of it will prove helpful. It’s important to only work with usable data – otherwise, we wouldn’t have time to analyse it all.
As we explored in our introduction to data mining article, we can do this via a process called data mining. By mining data, you can extract useful information from larger raw data sets. The process uses mathematical and statistical algorithms to detect correlations, patterns, or anomalies in data.

## Machine learning
A crucial concept in data science, machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that allows machines to learn from data and improve. Machine learning algorithms are used to teach computers to think in the same way that humans do. 
Machine learning utilises past experiences to better understand statistical patterns in the future. As the machine is given more data to consume, it will gradually become better at identifying differences in data.

## Data visualisation
When you have large data sets to work with and lots of insights to mull over, it can be overwhelming at times to review the data. Also, you may need to share your data with others that may not be able to understand and process data.
That’s where data visualisation tools come in. These tools let you create charts, graphs, maps, dashboards, and more that visualise meaningful data. They’re an excellent way to ‘translate’ data to others. We’ll take a look at some examples of these tools in a moment.

## Data science tools 
Programming languages – Programming skills can help you extract data, clean data, and even visualise it. Some of the most common languages used in data science are Python, R, and SQL. 
Visualisation tools – these are used to make data digestible. Some data visualisation tools include Tableau, Google charts, and data wrapper.
Database management systems – used to store and manage vast amounts of data; some examples include Snowflake and MySQL.
